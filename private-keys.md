# Private Keys and Mnemonics

## Intro

- Asymetric Cryptography

- Used for transaction signature in crypto

- Usage in Wallets

## Private Key

- 64 random HEX

- e.g. `0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001`


## Public Key

- Derived from private key

- Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)

- Last 40 characters is the address

## Signature

- Not Encryption

- Can be used to derive Public key

## Mnemonics

- A way to derive multiple private keys

- More human friendly

## Coding Time!

- Private key generator
