# Ethereum Merge

ETA 15. September 2022

## What will happen

* Consensus Mechanism - Proof of Work (PoW) -> Proof of Stake (PoS)
    - Ensures validity
    - Proof of Work - Cryptographic Puzzle, Dynamic difficulty, Price you are willing to pay = gas fees
    - Proof of Stake - Stake directly, stake through pools,

* Merge of Beacon Chain -> mainnet

* We went through many testnet merges (ropsten, rinkeby, ...)

## PoW -> PoS explained
```
|-------|       |-------|
|  id   |<--|   | id    |
|       |   |---| prev  |
|       |       | 0x124
|-------|       |-------|
```

## Changes

- Energy footprint goes down by ~99%
- It is easier to participate
- Lower issuence

## What is going to stay the same!

- Pretty much everything else
- Gas fees won't change - it is still supply vs demand
- No scalability upgrades
- Not unstakable
- No action by users or developers
- State is not changed
